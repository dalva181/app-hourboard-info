    <h1>Hourboard iOS: Support & FAQ</h1>

    <h2>What is an Hourboard, and how does it work?</h2>
    <div>An Hourboard is like a scoreboard, but for your school, work, and/or personal projects. 
        Instead of keeping score of a game, you're keeping score of the hours you work on a project.
        You're also keeping score of when you achieve a particular milestone (referred to as "hourstones" in the app),
        indicating the specific hour in which you accomplish one after any given project session.
    </div>

    <h2>How do I create an Hourboard and access it?</h2>
    <div>In the app's home screen, on the bottom left corner there is a button that says "New Hourboard".
        Enter the title of your Hourboard, its initial three hourstones, and your planned date of completion.
        Once it's created, tap on the row of the table that contains your Hourboard.
    </div>

    <h2>How do I delete an Hourboard?</h2>
    <div>In the app's home screen, swipe left on the row of the Hourboard you wish to delete and tap the trash icon. You
        will get a confirmation alert.
    </div>

    <h2>How do I log my sessions?</h2>
    <div>In the page of your specific Hourboard, on the bottom left corner there is a button that says "New Session".
        Enter the hours worked in that particular session, customize the hour bubble's color if desired by tapping on the icon,
        enter the hour in which you achieved the Hourboard's current milestone (or blank if you are still working on it),
        and then the date of when you completed the session.
    </div>

    <h2>How do I view, reorder, rename, add, or delete my Hourstones?</h2>
    <div>
        <li>To view your Hourstones, tap the rectangle-with-a-pencil icon located on the top right corner of your
        Hourboard's sessions screen.</li>
        <li>To reorder your Hourstones, long-press on the (incomplete) Hourstone you wish to reorder and move it to the
            desired position. You cannot move completed Hourstones nor move incomplete Hourstones in between completed ones.
        </li>
        <li>To rename an Hourstone, swipe left on the Hourstone you wish to remain. Tap the pencil icon in green.
        </li>
        <li>To add a new Hourstone, tap the New button on the top right corner. New Hourstones are added to the end of the list.
        </li>
        <li>To delete an existing Hourstone, swipe left on the Hourstone you wish to delete. You can only delete Hourstones that are not marked complete.
            You must also have at least one Hourstone.
        </li>
    </div>

    <h2>How do I delete a completed Hourstone?</h2>
    <div>To be able to delete a completed Hourstone, you must first delete the session that contains
        that particular Hourstone you marked complete. To delete the session, swipe left on the specific session's row
        and tap the trash icon. You can only delete the most recently created session; in order to delete an Hourstone
        contained in a session that is not the most recently created one, you must delete all sessions after it first. After that,
        the Hourstone is marked incomplete, and you can delete it.
    </div>

    <h2>How do I change the color of a session's hour bubbles if I already made it?</h2>
    <div>Swipe left on the session you wish to recolor its hour bubbles of and tap the paint board icon in mint.</div>

    <h2>How do I change the title of my Hourboard, change its Hourstone bubble colors, change its planned completion, or
        change its status?
    </h2>
    <div>In the app's home screen, swipe left on the row of the Hourboard you wish to modify and tap the gear icon in gray.
        The subsequent screen has all you need.
    </div>
